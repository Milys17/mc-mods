	"1.9.17": "- Fixed a bug where the Materializer GUI would crash if more than 110 recipes were available\n- The Interdimensional Cage blacklist actually works now\n- The obsidian platform that generates when Sacthoth spawns doesn't replace blocks that the explosion couldn't destroy\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not the Night Vision buff from the Plated Coralium Helmet should be applied in all dimensions\n- Reworked the internals of the Dark Resurrection ritual to properly support having multiple dead mobs with the same name\n- Improved the code that checks if a player has a Necronomcion when interacting with a Remnant\n- Engravings no longer stack if they have lost durability\n- All offensive spells now respect PVP settings and player teams\n- Engravings can no longer be repaired\n- Added a new config section for spells (so you can disable individual spells)",

	"1.9.15": "- Anti-Players now despawn (under normal circumstances)\n- If a player dies to Antimatter, the Anti-Player that spawns will have the player's name\n- If an Anti-Player kills a player, there will actually be a chance of an Anti-Player spawning\n- Air pockets no longer generate beneath shoggoth lairs\n- Spectral Dragons, Asorah, Cha'garoth, J'zahar and Sacthoth can now be killed using /kill\n- Improved the scrolling inside the Materializer GUI (also fixes a bug related to scrolling)\n- Added some more Materialization recipes (Coal Block, Redstone Block, Diamond and Diamond Ore)",
	"1.9.14": "- Added a config option to disable the plague Enchantments\n- The Ritual Altar and Sacrificial Altar now adds the Glowing Potion Effect to its target (instead of making it emit smoke)\n- Place of Power previews now show a tooltip with the blocks used to build it when hovered over\n- All Shadow mobs now become completely invisible when it's dark enough (instead of barely visible). Bring torches with you to the Dark Realm!\n- You can no longer brew Potions of Annihilation (considering how powerful the Potion Effect is, being able to brew it was just broken OP)\n- Made the usability check in the crystal bag inventory more strict (fixes a dupe bug)\n- Added a ritual (named Mass Enchantment) that combines the Enchantments of 8 Enchanted Books, then applies them on whatever is on the altar\n- Added a config option to set the combined max level a single Enchantment can have in the Mass Enchantment ritual\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not you can enchant books through the Mass Enchantment ritual\n- Added a Creative Tab for all registered spells\n- Fixed the rendering of the primed ODB (should've done this half a decade ago...), also changed the particle spawning\n- Also totally a 7 year anniversary update",

	"1.9.13": "- Capabilities (like Embers heat) will now persist with Upgrade Kit upgrading\n- Improved the explosion code a fair bit\n- Large explosions no longer create particles (either the particles were oddly placed, or simply too many, might replace with something else in the future)\n- Added a config option for the size of an ODB explosion (also increased the default size)\n- Added a config option for the size of antimatter explosions (also increased the default size)\n- AbyssalCraft Explosions now deal more correct amounts of damage (the exposure property from the vanilla explosion damage code kinda nullified the damage)\n- The particle display from the Ritual Pedestals can now be customized for each individual ritual through a set of predefined sequences\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not Upgrade Kits and the mechanic for them are added (courtesy of Mike-U5)\n- The ritual chant is now played on the server side instead of the client (so you'll always hear a chant when performing rituals while playing on a server)\n- Changed most of the ritual types to use the new particle displays\n- Sacthoth now wields his Soul Reaper Blade (and swings his arm)\n- Added two Enchantments for the Staff of Rending (Sapping and Multi-rend, Sapping increases the amount of energy drained by the staff, and Multi-rend drains energy from mobs near the target)\n- Moved the Potential Energy section out from the Ritual section in the Necronomicon\n- All Tile Entities with Capabilities properly indicate that they have them (so that pipes, for one, interacts with them)",
	"1.9.12": "- Added a config option to toggle whether or not food items are added (courtesy of Mike-U5)\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not the dimension terrain will be affected by the Amplified world type\n- Improved the generation code for the random Abyssal Wasteland structures (they're no longer height dependent, so they're more likely to generate in an amplified world)\n- Attempting to use any bonemeal-esque items in a Purged biome won't consume the item if it's not stackable\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not statues can generate inside Shoggoth Lairs\n- The \"Dark Resurrection\" Ritual can now resurrect any named mob that has died (and any player can resurrect any named dead mob)\n- Adjusted the rotation of Remnant leg tentacles when riding something\n- Added a JSON file with previously hardcoded colors (for resource packs to override) named \"clientvars.json\"\n- Dread Spawn, Greater Dread Spawn, Lesser Dreadbeast and Spawn of Cha'garoth now have their own textures (rather than using the Dreadguard texture)",

	"1.9.9": "- Energy Container/Pedestal/Collector/Relay and Sacrificial Altars now behave as Items capable of holding PE in Item form (instead of only displaying the amount of energy contained)\n- However, they don't transfer/receive PE externally, so rituals won't drain from them, nor will statues charge them while in your hand or on the ground\n- The Dreadium Katana can now be enchanted properly on an enchanting table\n- Added Cha'rcoal (like Charcoal, except something's off about it...)\n- Added configurable plague immunities (you can make mobs from other mods immune and or carriers of the Coralium and Dread Plagues)\n- Added a secondary Darklands Oak Wood Block, which has the blinking spots\n- Re-added Inventory Tweaks support for Crystal Bags\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not J'zahar can break the fourth wall\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Lesser Shoggoths are immune to projectile damage\n- The \"Liquid Coralium transmutation\" config option now also controls whether or not Liquid Coralium can transmute non-fluid blocks into their Abyssal Wasteland counterparts\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Disruptions can occur from statues or failing rituals\n- Added a config option to disable J'zahar's black hole attack\n- Reduced the amount of skins needed to upgrade the Necronomicon (3 now, previously 8)",
