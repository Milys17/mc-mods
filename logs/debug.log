	"1.9.19": "- Changed the default values for a couple of config options (check the description of GitHub commit 69817fc for more info)\n- Changed the internals of fuel handling for the Crystallizer and Transmutator (event runs before the defaults are applied, so you can override them)\n- Added some ambient void particle rendering in Omothol and the Dark Realm\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Evil Animals spawn Demon Animals on death\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Evil Animals only spawn at night during a new moon\n- Fixed the sky color in the Darklands biome\n- Omothol Ghouls are actually immune to fire now (apparently they weren't, despite the book claiming they were)\n- The PE Stream particle (the thing you see when PE is being transferred) now respects the particle settings (lower setting = fewer particles)\n- Changed a plethora of Crystallizer recipes (added ore doubling, among others) and Transmutator recipes (reverting crystals is cost inefficient) along with removing crystals as fuels\n- Added a config option (under modules) to revert back to the old recipes and behavior\n- Crystal Clusters are now in the Ore Dictionary (as \"crystalClusterX\", where X is the element)\n- Added Calcium, Beryllium and Beryl crystals to the Ore Dictionary\n- Reworked the PE transfer logic in the statues to increase performance\n- Added an upper limit to how many PE particles can spawn at a time (should boost performance for larger PE generation and/or transportation setups)\n- Optimized the worshiping AI for Lesser Shoggoths and Remnants slightly\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Lesser Shoggoth eyes will glow (will save you some performance if you drop FPS while looking at them)\n- Added API support for adding your own Rendings to the Staff of Rending (currently the Rending Pedestal doesn't support custom Rendings)",
	"1.9.18": "- Fixed a rendering-related crash with the various fire blocks added in the mod\n- If \"Ooze Expiration\" is enabled, Shoggoth Ooze blocks that aren't full will shrink in size until they perish\n- Tied some loose ends triggering log errors when some modules are disabled\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not Anti-Players can pick up loot (you really should just blacklist them in the mob spawner/duplicator instead)\n- You can now open Necronomicons and Crystal Bags in the off hand\n- Energy draining (through rituals and spells) now both take the off hand slot into account",
	"1.9.17": "- Fixed a bug where the Materializer GUI would crash if more than 110 recipes were available\n- The Interdimensional Cage blacklist actually works now\n- The obsidian platform that generates when Sacthoth spawns doesn't replace blocks that the explosion couldn't destroy\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not the Night Vision buff from the Plated Coralium Helmet should be applied in all dimensions\n- Reworked the internals of the Dark Resurrection ritual to properly support having multiple dead mobs with the same name\n- Improved the code that checks if a player has a Necronomcion when interacting with a Remnant\n- Engravings no longer stack if they have lost durability\n- All offensive spells now respect PVP settings and player teams\n- Engravings can no longer be repaired\n- Added a new config section for spells (so you can disable individual spells)",

	"1.9.15": "- Anti-Players now despawn (under normal circumstances)\n- If a player dies to Antimatter, the Anti-Player that spawns will have the player's name\n- If an Anti-Player kills a player, there will actually be a chance of an Anti-Player spawning\n- Air pockets no longer generate beneath shoggoth lairs\n- Spectral Dragons, Asorah, Cha'garoth, J'zahar and Sacthoth can now be killed using /kill\n- Improved the scrolling inside the Materializer GUI (also fixes a bug related to scrolling)\n- Added some more Materialization recipes (Coal Block, Redstone Block, Diamond and Diamond Ore)",
	"1.9.14": "- Added a config option to disable the plague Enchantments\n- The Ritual Altar and Sacrificial Altar now adds the Glowing Potion Effect to its target (instead of making it emit smoke)\n- Place of Power previews now show a tooltip with the blocks used to build it when hovered over\n- All Shadow mobs now become completely invisible when it's dark enough (instead of barely visible). Bring torches with you to the Dark Realm!\n- You can no longer brew Potions of Annihilation (considering how powerful the Potion Effect is, being able to brew it was just broken OP)\n- Made the usability check in the crystal bag inventory more strict (fixes a dupe bug)\n- Added a ritual (named Mass Enchantment) that combines the Enchantments of 8 Enchanted Books, then applies them on whatever is on the altar\n- Added a config option to set the combined max level a single Enchantment can have in the Mass Enchantment ritual\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not you can enchant books through the Mass Enchantment ritual\n- Added a Creative Tab for all registered spells\n- Fixed the rendering of the primed ODB (should've done this half a decade ago...), also changed the particle spawning\n- Also totally a 7 year anniversary update",
	"1.9.13.1": "- Fixed a crash when any boss dialog is sent to chat on servers",
	"1.9.13": "- Capabilities (like Embers heat) will now persist with Upgrade Kit upgrading\n- Improved the explosion code a fair bit\n- Large explosions no longer create particles (either the particles were oddly placed, or simply too many, might replace with something else in the future)\n- Added a config option for the size of an ODB explosion (also increased the default size)\n- Added a config option for the size of antimatter explosions (also increased the default size)\n- AbyssalCraft Explosions now deal more correct amounts of damage (the exposure property from the vanilla explosion damage code kinda nullified the damage)\n- The particle display from the Ritual Pedestals can now be customized for each individual ritual through a set of predefined sequences\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not Upgrade Kits and the mechanic for them are added (courtesy of Mike-U5)\n- The ritual chant is now played on the server side instead of the client (so you'll always hear a chant when performing rituals while playing on a server)\n- Changed most of the ritual types to use the new particle displays\n- Sacthoth now wields his Soul Reaper Blade (and swings his arm)\n- Added two Enchantments for the Staff of Rending (Sapping and Multi-rend, Sapping increases the amount of energy drained by the staff, and Multi-rend drains energy from mobs near the target)\n- Moved the Potential Energy section out from the Ritual section in the Necronomicon\n- All Tile Entities with Capabilities properly indicate that they have them (so that pipes, for one, interacts with them)",
	"1.9.12": "- Added a config option to toggle whether or not food items are added (courtesy of Mike-U5)\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not the dimension terrain will be affected by the Amplified world type\n- Improved the generation code for the random Abyssal Wasteland structures (they're no longer height dependent, so they're more likely to generate in an amplified world)\n- Attempting to use any bonemeal-esque items in a Purged biome won't consume the item if it's not stackable\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not statues can generate inside Shoggoth Lairs\n- The \"Dark Resurrection\" Ritual can now resurrect any named mob that has died (and any player can resurrect any named dead mob)\n- Adjusted the rotation of Remnant leg tentacles when riding something\n- Added a JSON file with previously hardcoded colors (for resource packs to override) named \"clientvars.json\"\n- Dread Spawn, Greater Dread Spawn, Lesser Dreadbeast and Spawn of Cha'garoth now have their own textures (rather than using the Dreadguard texture)",

	"1.9.10": "- All bosses are now immune to Potion Effects\n- The Materializer no longer crashes when you put a Crystal Bag in the Crystal Bag slot\n- Prevented some tooltips in other mods from revealing the text of locked items\n- Removed Abyssalnite Armor from the Village Blacksmith loot table\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not mod items should be added to vanilla loot tables\n- Dreadlands portals can no longer spread Dreadlands around themselves\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not Depths Ghouls should use the Biome Dictionary for finding biomes to spawn in\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not Abyssal Zombies should use the Biome Dictionary for finding biomes to spawn in",
	"1.9.9": "- Energy Container/Pedestal/Collector/Relay and Sacrificial Altars now behave as Items capable of holding PE in Item form (instead of only displaying the amount of energy contained)\n- However, they don't transfer/receive PE externally, so rituals won't drain from them, nor will statues charge them while in your hand or on the ground\n- The Dreadium Katana can now be enchanted properly on an enchanting table\n- Added Cha'rcoal (like Charcoal, except something's off about it...)\n- Added configurable plague immunities (you can make mobs from other mods immune and or carriers of the Coralium and Dread Plagues)\n- Added a secondary Darklands Oak Wood Block, which has the blinking spots\n- Re-added Inventory Tweaks support for Crystal Bags\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not J'zahar can break the fourth wall\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Lesser Shoggoths are immune to projectile damage\n- The \"Liquid Coralium transmutation\" config option now also controls whether or not Liquid Coralium can transmute non-fluid blocks into their Abyssal Wasteland counterparts\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not Disruptions can occur from statues or failing rituals\n- Added a config option to disable J'zahar's black hole attack\n- Reduced the amount of skins needed to upgrade the Necronomicon (3 now, previously 8)",
	"1.9.8": "- Decorative Statue crafting recipes now use the Ore Dictionary for the dyes\n- The Interdimensional Cage ritual now requires the Dreadlands Necronomicon (it's only required in the Dreadlands for progression, and was obtainable form the start)\n- If all registered dimensions are blacklisted, J'zahar's black holes will teleport you to the Dark Realm\n- The chest in Cha'garoth's Lair now generates with treasure inside again\n- The Dreadium Katana can now be enchanted\n- The various rituals for changing biomes now change a much larger area (32x32 chunks, previously 8x8)\n- The Ritual of Corruption now changes birch and roofed forests too (rather than only oak forests)\n- Started work on optimizing the explosion code for the ODB (and ODB Core by extension)\n- Deduplicated language keys used by other mods\n- Depths Ghoul heads now work as Thaumcraft infusion crafting stabilisers again (did I forget to...? Yes, yes I did)\n- The Depths armor set now provides a vis discount again\n- Lesser Shoggoths now only build monoliths on Shoggoth Ooze blocks, preventing them from building them in the lair walls (or any inaccessible space)",
	"1.9.7": "- Lesser Shoggoths now ignore Zombie Villagers\n- If any of the \"Shoggoth Lair Generation Chance\" options are set to 0, lairs won't generate in those areas, instead of causing a crash\n- The textures for the Dark Offspring have been tweaked to look a bit more spooky and goatish\n- Started preliminary work on optimizing worldgen features (trees, structures etc). Might not have a noticeable effect, but it's better than it was before\n- Swapped the texts on the pages for the Decorative Shub-Niggurath and Yog-Sothoth Statues\n- NecroData Chapter Page removal now reorders the remaining pages, instead of leaving blanks\n- Added a method to Chapters allowing you to insert Pages (which doesn't override existing Pages, as the method for adding Pages does)\n- Fuel registration for the Crystallizer and Transmutator are now handled through an event\n- Dark Offsprings now only spawn during night, and their spawning is dependant on the moon phase (more common during a new moon, very rare during a full moon)\n- Lowered the sound volume of the Dark Offspring\n- Added a much needed information section to spells explaining how to inscribe them, cast them, and other useful information (the amount of information is a bit limited right now)\n- Added some new Place of Power structures\n- The Great Old Ones Necronomicon section is now named \"The Great Old Ones\" again, instead of \"Pantheon\" (which is the name of the category it's part of)",

	"1.9.5.4": "- Custom NBT added through a summoning ritual will now work for all properties that can be changed through NBT (instead of only mob-specific properties)\n- Fuzzy NBT checking is now handled properly (if Item Stack A has no NBT, but Item Stack B does, they will be equal as B \"contains\" A)",
	"1.9.5.3": "- The plague antidotes can now be used 10 times before they run out (and the texture indicates how many uses are left)\n- The plague enchantments no longer infect other players if you hit them while PVP is disabled\n- Rituals now drain energy every second, instead of every tick (fixes rounding errors for energy amounts below 100)\n- Knowledge syncing when changing dimensions now has a configurable delay (sending the data later should reduce initial lag when loading the dimension)\n- Revamped the Lair of Cha'garoth a bit (Dreadstone Cobblestone floor, 30% of the Dreadstone Bricks are cracked)\n- You can now automatically insert items into the Energy Depositioner\n- The rotation of a Energy Relay can be changed by right-clicking it (which cycles through the possible directions)\n- Powerstone Trackers now move towards the nearest unexplored stronghold (a stronghold is considered explored if the Dreadlands Infused Powerstone has been mined)\n- Removed Oblivion Catalysts from the village blacksmith chest loot table (not sure why I added it there in the first place, nor why I didn't remove it earlier)\n- Lowered the chance of finding a Transmutation Gem in the Abyssal Stronghold and Dreadlands Mineshaft loot tables (made more sense back when they were single-use items, they're also damaged when you find them)\n- Transmutation Gems no longer display their durability tooltip if advanced tooltips (F3 + H) are shown\n- Changed the \"The Great Old Ones\" Necronomicon section name to \"Pantheon\" (as opposed to having the former appear twice)\n- All crafting recipes (except the NBT-sensitive ones) are now JSON files\n- Heavily reduced the amount of crafting recipes for the Coralium Infused Stone and the various Coralium Gem Clusters (60 of those recipes were probably never used)\n- Added a hook that allows you do add custom NBT data to a mob summoned through a summoning ritual",
	"1.9.5.2": "- When \"Display Item Names\" is enabled, you actually see the Item names, instead of \"Lorem ipsum\"\n- The Purging ritual now ignores unbreakable blocks (so modded bedrock blocks won't get replaced)\n- Shoggoth Biomass no longer spawn anything if the doMobSpawning gamerule is set to false\n- Changed the default value for Portal Cooldown to 100 ticks (previously 10)",
